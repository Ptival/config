# Setup (August 2020)

The `nixpkgs` directory should be symbolically linked in the users `~/.config`:

`/home/<user>/.config/nixpkgs -> /home/<user>/config/nixpkgs`

Additionally, on NixOS, the `nixos` directory should be symbolically linked in
`/etc`:

This should be enough to

`/etc/nixos -> /home/<user>/config/nixos`

This should be enough to run:

`sudo nixos-rebuild switch`

which should build NixOS and install it, as well as provide home-manager, and
then run:

`home-manager switch`

which should build all the user packages and install them and work its symlink
magic.

# Details

The current setup uses a minimal configuration.nix with home-manager providing
most packages.  Dot-files should live in `dotfiles/` and be linked by
home-manager in their expected locations.

Hardware-specific settings (generated by nix) should live in
`hardware-configuration/`, and each machine should have a symbolic link
`machine-specific.nix` pointing to their respective
`hardware-configuration/<machine>.nix`.

Machine-specific settings (handwritten by yours truly) should live in
`machine-specific/`, and each machine should have a symbolic link
`machine-specific.nix` pointing to their respective
`machines-specific/<machine>.nix`.


# Terminal setup

Unfortunately, getting powerlevel10k to look good is very hard, because of
pixel-based rendering imperfections.

What currently works, though the text looks huge, is to use the Terminator
terminal, and set its font to be Iosevka SS05 Regular, at size 22!

Modifying p10k to use separators that don't display poorly (avoiding all the
rounded and slanted ones) may be an option to having a smaller terminal text
size without infuriating pixel issues. :-)
