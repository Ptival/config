# Terminal setup

Unfortunately, getting powerlevel10k to look good is very hard, because of
pixel-based rendering imperfections.

What currently works, though the text looks huge, is to use the Terminator
terminal, and set its font to be Iosevka SS05 Regular, at size 22!

Modifying p10k to use separators that don't display poorly (avoiding all the
rounded and slanted ones) may be an option to having a smaller terminal text
size without infuriating pixel issues. :-)
